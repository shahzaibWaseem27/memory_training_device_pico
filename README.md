A PCB containing a Raspberry Pi Pico enclosed in a 3D-printed casing used as a memory training device.

The device contains two LEDs that blink in a pattern with a length and speed. The user must memorize and recreate the pattern by pressing the buttons corresponding to the LEDs.

After every successful attempt, the lengtha and speed of the blinking LED patterns will increase. Upon a failed attempt, the pattern speed will be reset, and the pattern will start again from the beginning.
